<p class="intro">"An important key to making a great picture is to have a crystal clear
   idea about what you want your photography to say. Not necessarily that particular image,
   but your body of work in general. Clear vision about what you are saying will make a huge
   difference in the quality of images. Itâ€™s helpful to remember that photography is a language.
   Just like French or German. There is a visual alphabet and you use that alphabet to put together
   the elements in a way that conveys the message you want to say. Just like a writer combines words
   to make sentences. Writing, in fact, is a good way to compare it to. You know how some people write
   something and it goes on and on and will bore you out of your skull. Others write in ways that will
   compel you to laugh out loud or cry. And the best writers have a clear idea of what they want to say.
    What they want their message to mean. Great photographers are the same way."</p>
