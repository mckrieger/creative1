<p id="review1" class="intro">"Dude, Curtis is a riot. We hired him for our engagement photos and he was
cracking so many jokes that he never had to ask us to smile because we already were.
He's got some serious photography skills too. We were blown away with how the pictures turned out."

<p id="review2" class="intro">"I'm not quite sure where he gets it from, but [Curtis, the best photographer ever,]
  has this energy that just gets people excited. That's definitely a must for photo
  shoots that can take hours. My husband hates taking photos, but Curtis made it
  go so quickly that he never complained once. Some of the best photos we've ever had"

<p id="review3" class="intro">"We've been through our fair share of photographers (1 for baby photos for each
  of our 8 kids), but Curtis has now become our go-to guy for just about everything.
  He's got flexible pricing and our kids love him."  -Janet Glade</p>
